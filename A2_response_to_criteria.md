Core criteria
------------------------------------------------

### Core - First data persistence service

- **AWS service name:**  S3
- **What data is being stored?:** Video files and thumbnail pictures
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** S3 is well-suited for storing large files like videos and images due to its scalability, durability, and efficient access to such content.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** Other services like DynamoDB are not optimal for large files, which are better handled for object storage.
- **Bucket/instance/table name:** videostorage-aaban
- **Video timestamp:** 00:00
- **Relevant files:**
    - backend/server.js
    - frontend/src/components/Upload.js

### Core - Second data persistence service

- **AWS service name:** MongoDB (Self-hosted on EC2)
- **What data is being stored?:** Data about videos, including title, description, uploader information, and paths to transcoded versions.
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** Document based storage is optimal for handling video data due to the flexibility, allowing for easy updates and handling of relationships between data.
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** S3 is not meant for structured datas compared to MongoDB.
- **Bucket/instance/table name:** videosharingapp
- **Video timestamp:** 00:59
- **Relevant files:**
    -backend/server.js

### Third data service

- **AWS service name:**  [eg. RDS]
- **What data is being stored?:** [eg video metadata]
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** [eg. ]
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:** [eg. Advanced video search requires complex querries which are not available on S3 and inefficient on DynamoDB]
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

- **S3 Bucket names:** videostorage-aaban
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:** 00:00
    -/backend/server.js
    -/videos/:id, /videos/thumbnails/:id

### In-memory cache

- **ElastiCache instance name:**
- **What data is being cached?:** [eg. Thumbnails from YouTube videos obatined from external API]
- **Why is this data likely to be accessed frequently?:** [ eg. Thumbnails from popular YouTube videos are likely to be shown to multiple users ]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Core - Statelessness

- **What data is stored within your application that is not stored in cloud data services?:** Intermediate transcoded video files before they are uploaded to S3.
- **Why is this data not considered persistent state?:** These files are temporary and are removed after successful upload to S3. They can be recreated from the original uploaded file if lost.
- **How does your application ensure data consistency if the app suddenly stops?:** Intermediate transcoded files are only kept until they are successfully uploaded to S3. If interrupted, transcoding can be restarted from the source.
- **Relevant files:**
    -/backend/server.js
    -unlinkAsync

### Graceful handling of persistent connections

- **Type of persistent connection and use:** [eg. server-side-events for progress reporting]
- **Method for handling lost connections:** [eg. client responds to lost connection by reconnecting and indicating loss of connection to user until connection is re-established ]
- **Relevant files:**
    -


### Core - Authentication with Cognito

- **User pool name:** n12170887-cognito-prac
- **How are authentication tokens handled by the client?:** Tokens are generated by AWS Cognito during login and sent to the backend via Authorization headers.
- **Video timestamp:** 01:58
- **Relevant files:**
    -/backend/middleware/authenticateJwt.js

### Cognito multi-factor authentication

- **What factors are used for authentication:** [eg. password, SMS code]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Cognito federated identities

- **Identity providers used:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Cognito groups

- **How are groups used to set permissions?:** Different users can't delete each others videos
- **Video timestamp:** 03:29
- **Relevant files:**
    -/backend/middleware/authenticateJwt.js
    -/backend/server.js

### Core - DNS with Route53
